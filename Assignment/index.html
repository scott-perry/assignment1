<main>
  <p>CossiePlay  is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create  outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from  simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced  features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force  fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and  cost between $10 and $10,000.<br>
  We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is  available) as well.<br>
  On the first Saturday of every month we hold a &ldquo;CossiePlay  Party&rdquo; at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids  under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick.  Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party  (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).</p></main>

  <p>We have some cool things happening that we want people to  know about: this month you can purchase 3 drinks for the price of 2 at the bar.<br>
    First-time party-goers get a 50% discount on entry<br>
    If you get a costume custom made, your next party entry is  free if you wear that costume.<br>
  Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you can  get a free drink with a 21-piece bucket. Tell them you&rsquo;ve been to CossiePlay!</p>
