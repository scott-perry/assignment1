<h1> CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p>Scott Perry,	jc428981&gt;</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The new site targets teenagers and young adults aiming to expand the age group of cosplayers attending themonthly parties and increasing the amount of costumes sold. The auidence of the website aims to target anyone who is interested in cosplay aswell as regular party-goers at Cossie Play. </p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Before the release of the website three months of data was recorded to track how many people purchased a costume and/or attended the monthly parties. Over the three parties an average of how many people participated and the average number of costumes sold. The following three months, after the release of the website, will be completed the same way. Each party names were also taken and put into a tally to see if any patrons continued to come back to parties every month. After three months if there is a higher average coming to the parties it would be respectable to say that the website successfully achieved the target goal. As Cossie Play has never used any form of proper advertisement.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Cossie Play wants to have a wide range of different age groups attending the parties. Currently the age group attending the parties is between 35-50 and they want to increase there target audience to teenages to young adults also making it open to everyone else. Therefore the website created will need to be concise, modern and contain pictures as many teens do not like alot of reading and rather get straight to the point. The website contains an announcement banner on three of five pages allowing the user to go straight to the sign up page. After the requirements of signing up on the sign up page there is a button which takes the user to the list of costumes. However it is possible to go back to any page from whatever page the user happens to be, making the navigation of the website fast and easy. Having prictures on multiple pages keep the website from looking blank and boring, keeping the audience intrigued. Displaying the costumes in images helps portray how different costumes may look for people who are unsure or new to cosplay. In general making this the best way for young adults and teenagers to view and navigate the website. </p>
