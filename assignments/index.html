<main><p>CossiePlay  is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012 creating  outstanding custom-made costumes. Anyone interseted in cosplay can order any kind of costume  - from  simple spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced  features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force  fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 to 50 weeks and  cost between $10 to $10,000.<br> We also buy and sell second-hand costumes.<br> On the first Saturday of every month we hold a &ldquo;CossiePlay  Party&rdquo; at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids  under 6 are free each entry including one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick.  The music starts at 6pm and finishes at 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party  who's open to suggestions and dancing is common but there are tables and chairs if dancing is'nt for you.</p></main>
